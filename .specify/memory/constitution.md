# Todo Application Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. No Manual Coding Allowed
All Python code must be generated by the AI agent. Human developers may only write specifications, plans, prompts, and review iterations. Any manual edit to generated code disqualifies the submission.

### II. Agentic Dev Stack Workflow
Follow the strict order: (a) Receive or refine specification, (b) Generate detailed implementation plan, (c) Break plan into small, atomic tasks, (d) For each task: generate complete, runnable code that integrates with previous parts, (e) Validate against Spec-Kit Plus specifications, (f) Iterate if needed.

### III. Project Scope & Features (Exactly These 5 - No More, No Less)
- Add task: title + description → auto-increment ID → default incomplete
- View/List tasks: show ID, status ([ ] or [X]), title, truncated description
- Update task: by ID, modify title and/or description
- Delete task: by ID
- Mark complete/incomplete: by ID (toggle status)

### IV. Technical Constraints
- Python version: 3.13+
- Storage: In-memory only (list/dict of task objects, no files, no database)
- Dependencies: Minimal built-ins only. Prefer standard library (argparse optional, simple input loop acceptable)
- Package manager: UV (for any future deps, but avoid external packages if possible)
- Spec framework: Spec-Kit Plus must be imported and used for behavioral specifications

### V. Code Quality & Structure Requirements
- Follow PEP 8 strictly
- Use meaningful variable/class/function names
- Comprehensive type hints everywhere
- Modular structure with src/ directory containing main.py (CLI entry point) and todo.py (core logic)

### VI. Spec-Kit Plus Integration Rules
- Every major feature must have corresponding spec definitions
- Specs should be written in separate files under specs_history/
- Generated code must pass all defined specs

## Additional Constraints
- CLI Interface Guidelines: Simple REPL loop with supported commands (add, list, update, delete, complete, exit/quit)
- Output Format for Every Response: When implementing a task, provide short summary, updated plan, specific task, and full file content in markdown code blocks

## Development Workflow
- Specifications are defined in .specify/templates/spec-template.md
- Implementation plans are generated in .specify/templates/plan-template.md
- Tasks are broken down in .specify/templates/tasks-template.md
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are maintained in .specify/templates/adr-template.md

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other practices. All development must verify compliance with these principles. Complexity must be justified, and the development guidance in QWEN.md should be followed for runtime development guidance.
