# Todo Application Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. No Manual Coding Allowed
All Python code must be generated by the AI agent. Human developers may only write specifications, plans, prompts, and review iterations. Any manual edit to generated code disqualifies the submission.

### II. Agentic Dev Stack Workflow
Follow the strict order: (a) Receive or refine specification, (b) Generate detailed implementation plan, (c) Break plan into small, atomic tasks, (d) For each task: generate complete, runnable code that integrates with previous parts, (e) Validate against Spec-Kit Plus specifications, (f) Iterate if needed.

### III. Project Scope & Features (Basic + Intermediate Level)
- Basic Level (MUST retain existing functionality):
  - Add task: title + description → auto-increment ID → default incomplete
  - View/List tasks: show ID, status ([ ] or [X]), title, truncated description
  - Update task: by ID, modify title and/or description
  - Delete task: by ID
  - Mark complete/incomplete: by ID (toggle status)
- Intermediate Level (NEW requirements):
  - Priorities: Each task has priority "high", "medium", or "low" (default: "medium")
  - Tags/Categories: Each task can have multiple tags (list of strings)
  - Search: Find tasks by keyword in title or description (case-insensitive)
  - Filter: Show tasks by status, priority, or tag
  - Sort: Order tasks by priority, title, or tag (with default by creation order)

### IV. Technical Constraints
- Python version: 3.13+
- Storage: In-memory only (list/dict of task objects, no files, no database)
- Dependencies: Minimal built-ins only. Prefer standard library (argparse optional, simple input loop acceptable)
- Package manager: UV (for any future deps, but avoid external packages if possible)
- Spec framework: Spec-Kit Plus must be imported and used for behavioral specifications

### V. Code Quality & Structure Requirements
- Follow PEP 8 strictly
- Use meaningful variable/class/function names
- Comprehensive type hints everywhere
- Modular structure with src/ directory containing main.py (CLI entry point) and todo.py (core logic)
- Extended data model to include priority, tags, and created_at timestamp

### VI. CLI Interface Requirements
- Interactive menu loop with numbered options
- Commands must support priority and tags during task creation
- List command must support filtering, searching, and sorting options
- Clear prompts and user-friendly messages for all operations

## Additional Constraints
- Data Model: Each task must include id, title, description, completed status, priority, tags list, and created_at timestamp
- CLI Interface Guidelines: Support all Basic commands plus options for priority/tags in add/update, and filtering/sorting in list
- Output Format: Priority and tags must be clearly visible in task listings

## Development Workflow
- Specifications are defined in .specify/templates/spec-template.md
- Implementation plans are generated in .specify/templates/plan-template.md
- Tasks are broken down in .specify/templates/tasks-template.md
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are maintained in .specify/templates/adr-template.md

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other practices. All development must verify compliance with these principles. Complexity must be justified, and the development guidance in QWEN.md should be followed for runtime development guidance.
