# Todo Application Tasks Breakdown

## Summary
Created a comprehensive tasks breakdown for the command-line Todo application implementation. The tasks are organized by user stories to enable independent implementation and testing.

## Changes Made

- Organized tasks by user stories in priority order
- Defined dependencies between tasks
- Included parallel execution opportunities
- Aligned tasks with original feature requirements

## Validation
- All tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs and labels
- Each task is specific enough to be completed independently
- Tasks are organized in logical phases from setup to polish
- Dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified
