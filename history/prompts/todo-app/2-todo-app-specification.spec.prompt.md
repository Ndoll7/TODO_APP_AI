# Todo Application Feature Specification

## Summary
Created a comprehensive feature specification for a command-line Todo application. The specification outlines requirements for a CLI-based task management system with in-memory storage.

## Changes Made
- Created detailed feature specification document (specs_history/01-todo-app.spec.md)
- Defined user scenarios, functional requirements, success criteria, and key entities
- Created quality checklist to validate the specification
- Ensured all requirements align with the original feature description

## Validation
- Specification meets all quality criteria
- All functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- No implementation details leak into the specification
