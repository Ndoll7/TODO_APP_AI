# Implementation Plan: Todo App Advanced Features

**Branch**: `2-todo-advanced-features` | **Date**: 2025-12-27 | **Spec**: specs/2-todo-advanced-features/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/2-todo-advanced-features/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Extend the existing Intermediate Level Todo Console App with Advanced Level features: recurring tasks and due dates & time reminders. The implementation will maintain backward compatibility with existing tasks while adding new functionality.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Standard library only (no external dependencies)  
**Storage**: In-memory only (list of task objects, no files, no database)  
**Testing**: Manual testing based on specification requirements  
**Target Platform**: Console application  
**Project Type**: Single project with clean separation of concerns  
**Performance Goals**: Fast response times for search, filter, sort, and reminder operations  
**Constraints**: <45 seconds for recurring task creation, <30 seconds for due date setting, <5 seconds for reminder command  
**Scale/Scope**: Individual user console application

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*
