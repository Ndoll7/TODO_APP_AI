# Implementation Plan: Todo App Intermediate Features

**Branch**: `1-todo-intermediate-features` | **Date**: 2025-12-27 | **Spec**: specs/1-todo-intermediate-features/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/1-todo-intermediate-features/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Extend the existing Basic Level Todo Console App with Intermediate Level features: priorities & tags for tasks, search functionality, filtering capabilities, and sorting options. The implementation will maintain backward compatibility with existing tasks while adding new functionality.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Standard library only (no external dependencies)  
**Storage**: In-memory only (list of task objects, no files, no database)  
**Testing**: Manual testing based on specification requirements  
**Target Platform**: Console application  
**Project Type**: Single project with clean separation of concerns  
**Performance Goals**: Fast response times for search, filter, and sort operations  
**Constraints**: <30 seconds for task creation with priority/tags, <10 seconds for search, <15 seconds for filter/sort  
**Scale/Scope**: Individual user console application

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Follow agentic dev workflow: spec → plan → tasks → implementation - ✅ VERIFIED
- Retain all Basic Level functionality while adding Intermediate features - ✅ VERIFIED
- Use in-memory storage only (no files/database) - ✅ VERIFIED
- Follow PEP 8 with type hints everywhere - ✅ VERIFIED
- Maintain clean separation: data model, business logic, CLI interface - ✅ VERIFIED
- Support backward compatibility with existing tasks - ✅ VERIFIED
